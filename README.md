MacBitCoin
==========

A Bitcoin client for the Mac, written 100% from scratch in Objective C.

This is a total rewrite of the bitcoin codebase. It is not cryptographically secure, because no one else has looked
at it. The goal was to create a complete client and then get code review. That hasn't yet happened.

General, and mine, interest in Bitcoin has fallen off over the last few years. Despite that, I think OS X needs and 
deserves a first-class Bitcoin client.

Goals
=====

The main goal for the project was to have a client running persistently in the OS X menu bar that would alert you
when you received a payment and let you quickly pay other addresses.

It only got so far as joining the network.

OMG where to start?
